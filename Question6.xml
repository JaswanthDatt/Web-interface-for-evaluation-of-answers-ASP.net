  <ans>Inheritance facilitates code reuse. The sealed keyword prevents the inheritance of a class or certain class members that were previously marked virtual. The base keyword is used to access members of the base class from within a derived class. It specifies which base-class constructor should be called when creating instances of the derived class. Protected type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct, or in a class that is derived from that class.

public class BaseClass
{
    int num;
    public BaseClass()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("in BaseClass()");
    }
    public BaseClass(int i)
    {
        num = i;
        Console.WriteLine("in BaseClass(int i)");
    }
    public int GetNum()
    {
        return num;
    }
}

public class DerivedClass : BaseClass
{
   public DerivedClass() : base()
    {
    }
    public DerivedClass(int i) : base(i)
    {
    }
    static void Main()
    {
        DerivedClass md = new DerivedClass();
        DerivedClass md1 = new DerivedClass(1);
    }

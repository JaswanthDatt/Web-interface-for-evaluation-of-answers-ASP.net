  <ans>Exception handling
Exception handling is a mechanism in which a programming construct is used to consistently trap, intercept and handle the error occurred during application execution. The Common Language Runtime (CLR) of .NET Framework is designed to use an exception handling model based on exception objects and protected blocks of code.
The features of exception handling mechanism implemented in CLR are as follows:
a) Each language can have its own specification for handling exceptions without any restrictions
b) Exceptions are generated and handled irrespective of the language used and type of code (managed or unmanaged)
c) Exceptions can be thrown across process or machine boundaries

Exceptions provide a way to transfer control from one part of a program to another. C# exception handling is built upon four keywords: try, catch, finally and throw.

try: A try block identifies a block of code for which particular exceptions will be activated. It's followed by one or more catch blocks.

catch: A program catches an exception with an exception handler at the place in a program where you want to handle the problem. The catch keyword indicates the catching of an exception.

finally: The finally block is used to execute a given set of statements, whether an exception is thrown or not thrown. For example, if you open a file, it must be closed whether an exception is raised or not.

throw: A program throws an exception when a problem shows up. This is done using a throw keyword.</ans>
